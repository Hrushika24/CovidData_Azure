# CovidData_Azure

In this project, we successfully implemented a comprehensive data ingestion and processing solution leveraging Azure services. We began by ingesting data from Azure Blob Storage and a website into Azure Data Factory, where we designed pipelines for efficient data movement into the data lake. Triggers were configured to ensure timely execution of these pipelines. Furthermore, we applied transformations to the data using Data Flows within Azure Data Factory, enhancing its quality and structure. Integration with Azure SQL allowed us to perform advanced querying and analysis, enriching our insights. Upon completion, the solution was deployed and monitored using alerts, metrics, and analytics functionalities, ensuring its reliability and performance over time.
